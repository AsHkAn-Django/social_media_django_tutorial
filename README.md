# Social Media Django Tutorial

Just a quick little project I made while practicing Django and backend development.  
This is part of my journey as I learn and improve my skills.

## About the Project

A mini social media platform where users can follow others, view a personalized news feed, like, and comment on posts.
This project is built using Django and includes basic frontend styling with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and some JavaScript.  
I usually focus on the backend side of things and try to keep things simple and clean.  
Each project I make is a way for me to learn something new or reinforce what I already know.
